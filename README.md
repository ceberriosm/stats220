# stats220

1. This repository is for my *Stats220 Projects*
Here I coded up using **RStudio** the following projects:

* A meme.
* An animated GIF.
* A HTML site.

2. If you are interested about process, I invite you to have a look!

3. Many of the tool use in this project come from the package on R called magick clink in [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html) to see more information.
